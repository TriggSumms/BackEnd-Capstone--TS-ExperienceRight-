# BACKEND CAPSTONE- "EXPERIENCE RIGHT"

The application was designed to act as a liaison between the consumer and the business they are reviewing and ultimately is geared towards improving the customer experience! This is done through registering as either a business (to be reviewed) or a consumer (to do the reviewing).  

| As a reviewer, you will be directed towards this app by the business registered with XR. Thus, being able to create an account and post an experience you had with said business. After the reviewer finishes, they are free to read through other reviews for the business....to gage the communities rating or to check out other reviews written by users of the app.  

| As a business, you will register in our system and then spread the word that you have a futuristic application designed to hear out their concerns or answer questions they may have.  As soon as they review your business.... you can respond back and create that relationship with your consumer that you always wanted!
